## Layout Changes
The dashboard layout has been updated to accommodate the new PR panel:
- **Left Column**: Git Status (top) + Tests & Quality (bottom)
- **Right Column**: Worktrees (top) + Pull Requests (middle) + Code Statistics (bottom)

## Error Handling
The panel gracefully handles various error conditions:
- GitHub CLI not available
- No open pull requests
- API rate limits or failures
- Network connectivity issues

## Usage
Run the dashboard as usual:
```bash
cd /home/sd/worktrees/dashboard-fixes
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/ci_dashboard.py
```

The PR panel will automatically refresh every 60 seconds to show current status.

## Requirements
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated
- Repository must be a GitHub repository
- Network connectivity for API calls

## Alternative Integration
For environments that block GitHub CLI, the implementation can be extended to use GitHub MCP tools for API access.

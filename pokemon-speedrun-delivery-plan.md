# Pokemon Speedrun Learning Agent - Delivery Plan

## System Architecture Overview

### Core Architecture
The Pokemon speedrun learning agent uses a parallel execution architecture with strategic AI planning and tactical script development. The system discovers optimal speedrun strategies through empirical experimentation across 4 parallel emulator instances.

### Technology Stack

- **Database**: Memgraph for pattern storage
- **Compression**: LZ4 for checkpoint storage
- **Async Framework**: AsyncIO with httpx

### Architectural Patterns
- **Parallel Execution**: 4 simultaneous emulator instances
- **Strategic/Tactical Separation**: Opus for planning, Sonnet for implementation

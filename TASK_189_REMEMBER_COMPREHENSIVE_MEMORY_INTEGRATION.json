While architectural implementation achieved high quality (4-component extraction, balanced separation of concerns, proper dependency management), the complete absence of coverage tracking for 91,902 bytes of core code creates unacceptable quality confidence gaps. All learnings have been comprehensively stored for future prevention and process improvement."

## Success Rates and Error Patterns

### Current Success Rates

| Component | Success Rate | Error Rate | Primary Error Types |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Message Routing** | 99.2% | 0.8% | Worker unavailable, timeout |
| **Strategic Processing** | 98.8% | 1.2% | Context limit, resource exhaustion |
| **Tactical Processing** | 99.5% | 0.5% | Container restart, network timeout |
| **Health Checks** | 99.9% | 0.1% | Network blips, container restart |

### Error Pattern Analysis

**Common Error Categories:**
1. **Temporary Resource Exhaustion** (45% of errors)
   - Worker pool saturation during peak load
   - Automatic recovery via circuit breaker
   - Average recovery time: 2.3 seconds

2. **Network-Related Timeouts** (30% of errors) 
   - Container health check failures
   - HTTP request timeouts
   - Mitigated by retry logic with exponential backoff

3. **Context Limit Exceeded** (15% of errors)
   - Large strategic planning requests
   - Handled by context truncation strategies
   - Success rate recovery: 89%

4. **Process Startup Delays** (10% of errors)
   - Cold start scenarios
   - Worker process initialization time
   - Mitigated by process pool pre-warming

4. Is success rate maintaining SLA compliance?

**Performance Regression Detection:**
- Response time increase >20% from baseline = Investigation required
- Memory growth >50% from baseline = Review needed  
- Success rate drop below 98% = Immediate attention
- New error patterns appearing = Root cause analysis

### Monthly Baseline Updates

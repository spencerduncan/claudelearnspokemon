"""
Comprehensive test suite for MemgraphCheckpointDiscovery.

Production-grade testing following Clean Code and TDD principles:
- Unit tests for all methods with mocked memgraph connection
- Performance validation: <5ms discovery, <50ms save, <2ms fuzzy matching
- Thread safety validation with concurrent operations
- Error handling and edge cases
- CI-compatible with mock memgraph instances

Tests demonstrate the component meets aggressive performance targets
inspired by memoryalpha's 393x improvement.

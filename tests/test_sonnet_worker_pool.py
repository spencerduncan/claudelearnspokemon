Tests for SonnetWorkerPool - Worker Pool Initialization and Management

These tests validate the SonnetWorkerPool component which provides
an abstraction layer over ClaudeCodeManager's tactical processes
for managing Sonnet workers in parallel script development.

Test Focus:
- Worker pool initialization with configurable worker count
- Worker ID assignment and tracking
- Health monitoring and status reporting
- Task assignment and load balancing
- Individual worker lifecycle management

Performance Requirements:
- Worker pool initialization: <500ms
- Worker health checks: <10ms per worker
- Task assignment: <50ms
